A short description about series Friends
=========================================

# There are six characters.

Pheobe, played by Lisa Kudrow, is the wierdest character.
Chandler, my second favourite, is supposed to be the funniest one.
Joey is an actor and homemate of Chandler.

Chandler >> everyone else
Regina Phalange == Pheobe

Everything went down in the series the moment they came to London.
Coincidence?
