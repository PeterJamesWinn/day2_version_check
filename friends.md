A short description about series Friends
=========================================

### What do we think about the characters

Ross is terrible

#### There are six characters.

Pheobe, played by Lisa Kudrow, is the wierdest character.
Chandler, my second favourite, is supposed to be the funniest one.
Joey is an actor and homemate of Chandler.

Ross is high school friend of Chandler and Chandler >> everyone else

Regina Phalange == Pheobe

Everything went down in the series the moment they came to London.
Coincidence?

"London baby!"

"We were on a break!" Choose your side! Rachel? Ross?
