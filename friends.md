A short description about series Friends
=========================================
There are six characters.

Pheobe, played by Lisa Kudrow, is the wierdest character.
Chandler, my second favourite, is supposed to be the funniest one.
These two are the least funny ones.
Joey is an actor and homemate of Chandler.
